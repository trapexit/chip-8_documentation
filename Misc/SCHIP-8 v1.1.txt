  Subj: SUPER-CHIP v1.1 (now with scrolling)
  Date: Tue May 28 1991

Ok, here are a new version of S-CHIP. It is a lot faster than version
1.0 and have some new scroll functions. And it's still small!

I have copied parts of the original CHIP-48 documentation and added the
new functions that are available in S-CHIP. 

If you would like to start writing games for CHIP, read this, get yourself 
an assembler, look at someone else's program and get started! It's not 
difficult, you can get something up and working in just an hour or so. 
And you get the benefits of machine code - the speed - without having 
to learn all the internals of the 48. And it won't crash when you do 
something wrong (I hope...).

... and by the way, H. Piper is exactly the kind of super fantastic
games that I would like to see more of. Good work!


SUPER-CHIP v1.1
===============

... a modified version of the CHIP-8 game interpreter originally
made by Andreas Gustafsson.

S-CHIP offers:

- full screen resolution in new extended screen mode
- downward compability (you can run your old CHIP games)
- higher speed in extended mode
- a larger 16x16 sprite available
- new, larger fonts for scores
- you can pass information to and from a S-CHIP program
- programmable exit from the S-CHIP interpreter possible
- no need to turn off the clock
- it will always start
- instructions to scroll the screen down, left, and right


Introduction to CHIP
--------------------

For those who don't remember, the CHIP-8 programming language was
used in a number of home computers based on RCA's CDP1802 pro-
cessor in the late 1970's.  It's a small, interpreted language
designed specifically  for writing simple video games.  It has
less than 40 instructions, including arithmetic, control flow,
graphics, and sound.  The instructions are all 16 bits long and
are executed by a very compact virtual machine interpreter (the
1802 implementation was 512 bytes long).
 

Technical specification 
-----------------------

The CHIP-8 virtual machine is byte-addressable and has an address
space of 4 kB at addresses 000-FFF hex.  However, addresses
000-1FF are reserved (this is where the CHIP-8 interpreter used to
reside). Therefore, the CHIP-8 program itself begins at address
200. All instructions are 16 bits long and by convention instruc-
tions always start at an even address. 
 
The machine has 16 8-bit general-purpose registers called V0..VF. 
The VF register is modified by certain instructions and works as a
carry flag and sprite collision indicator.  There is also a 16-bit
pointer register I (though only the low 12 bits are generally
used). 
 
A CHIP-8 program displays graphics by drawing sprites that are 8 
pixels wide and 1..15 pixels high.  The screen resolution is 32 by
64 pixels in standard mode.  The origin is the upper left corner
of the screen, and all coordinates are positive.  The sprites are
stored in bigendian format, i.e., the most significant bit corre-
sponds to the leftmost pixel. All drawing is done in XOR mode. If
this causes one or more pixels to be erased, VF is <> 00, other-
wise 00.

In extended screen mode the resolution is 64 by 128 pixels. A
sprite of 16x16 size is available. 
 
There are two timers: the delay timer and the sound timer.  Both 
timers count down about 60 times per second when nonzero; the
speaker will beep whenever the sound timer is nonzero. 
 
In the instruction table below, NNN is a 12-bit address, KK is an 
8-bit constant, and X and Y are 4-bit register numbers.  Hex 
characters represent themselves.  The two first characters of the 
instruction code form the lower-address byte of the instruction,
the first character being the more significant nibble. 
 
Instructions marked with (*) are new in SUPER-CHIP.

Notes on the HP48SX implementation  
----------------------------------

CHIP-8 programs are stored in the HP48SX as string objects con-
taining the bytes of the program in increasing address order,
beginning with the byte at 0200.  The interpreter itself is a
machine code object that should be run with the CHIP-8 program
string on level 1. 4 kB of free memory is needed.  If an error is
detected during execution, the address of the current CHIP-8
instruction is returned as a binary integer on level 1. 
 
To quit, press the backspace key.  Pressing ENTER restarts the
CHIP-8 program, and the +/- key turns the sound off or on. 
 
Subroutine nesting is limited to 16 levels. 
 
Most chip-8 programs are written for a 16-key hex keyboard with  
following layout: 
 
  1 2 3 C                                               7 8 9 / 
  4 5 6 D    This keyboard is emulated on the HP48SX    4 5 6 * 
  7 8 9 E    using the following keys:                  1 2 3 - 
  A 0 B F                                               0 . _ + 
 
This may cause some confusion with programs requiring numerical
input.
